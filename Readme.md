Simon is an electronic game of short-term memory skills invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, working for a toy design firm Marvin Glass and Associates, with software programming by Lenny Cope.

It is made with __HTML__, __CSS__, __Javascript__ and __Jquery__.

## How to play
Game will start by pressing any keyboard button and one of the colours will fade out and fade.
- You need to remember which colour faded and click on that corresponding color only otherwise you loose.
- If you clicked the correct colour then again a randomly selected colour will fade out and fade in , now you need to remember first and the second colour , and first click the colour which occurred first and then click the second one.
- If you did it correctly then again a randomly selected colour will fade out and fade in and the game continues...

Hope you got it how to play the interesting memory skill game.
