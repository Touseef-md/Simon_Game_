Simon is an electronic game of short-term memory skills invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, working for a toy design firm Marvin Glass and Associates, with software programming by Lenny Cope.

It is made with __HTML__, __CSS__, __Javascript__ and __Jquery__.

## How to play
The game will start by pressing any keyboard button and one of the colours will fade out and fade.
- You need to remember which colour faded and click on that corresponding colour only otherwise you lose.
- If you clicked the correct colour then again a randomly selected colour will fade out and fade in, now you need to remember the first and the second colour, and first click the colour which occurred first and then click the second one.
- If you did it correctly then again a randomly selected colour will fade out and fade in and the game continues...

Hope you got how to play the interesting memory skill game.
